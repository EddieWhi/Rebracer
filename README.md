#Rebracer

Rebracer solves an age-old problem with working on C# projects from a variety of source: source formatting settings.
If you work on different open source projects, or on projects for different companies, each one is likely to have a different One True Brace Style, forcing you to change your Visual Studio settings every time you switch projects.

Rebracer solves this by storing these settings alongside each solution.  When you open a solution, Rebracer will automatically apply that solution's settings, leaving you free to write code as usual.
